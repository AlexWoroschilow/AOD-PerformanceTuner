<h2>power/control</h2>
<p>This file contains one of two words: <b>on</b> or <b>auto</b>. You can write those words to the file to change the deviceâ€™s setting.</p>
<p><b>on</b> means that the device should be resumed and autosuspend is not allowed. (Of course, system suspends are still allowed.)</p>
<p><b>auto</b> is the normal state in which the kernel is allowed to autosuspend and autoresume the device.</p>
<h2>power/autosuspend</h2>
<p>writing <b>0</b> to <b>power/autosuspend</b> would prevent the device from being autosuspended</p>
<h2>power/autosuspend_delay_ms</h2>
<p>This file contains an integer value, which is the number of milliseconds the device should remain idle before the kernel will autosuspend it (the idle-delay time). The default is <b>2000</b>. <b>0</b> means to autosuspend as soon as the device becomes idle, and negative values mean never to autosuspend. You can write a number to the file to change the autosuspend idle-delay time.</p>
